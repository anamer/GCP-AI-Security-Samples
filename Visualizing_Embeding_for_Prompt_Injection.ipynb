    "A vector embedding is a way of representing words or phrases as vectors of numbers. This can be used to do things like find similar words or phrases, or to understand the meaning of a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different ways to create vector embeddings, but one common approach is to use a neural network. The neural network is trained on a large corpus of text, and it learns to associate each word or phrase with a vector of numbers. The vectors can then be used to represent the meaning of words or phrases, or to find similar words or phrases.\n",

    "Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that is used to reduce the number of variables in a dataset while retaining as much of the information as possible. PCA does this by finding a set of orthogonal (uncorrelated) vectors called principal components, which are linear combinations of the original variables. The principal components are ordered in such a way that the first principal component accounts for as much of the variance in the data as possible, the second principal component accounts for as much of the remaining variance as possible, and so on.\n",

    "In this section, we will explore methods to bypass embedding protection by modifying the characteristics of a given prompt to make it distinct from others. By selecting one of the previously listed prompts, we'll attempt to alter its semantic content or structure significantly enough so that it becomes uniquely distinguishable from the rest. This involves experimenting with different phrasings, integrating unique concepts, or shifting the context. The goal is to achieve a degree of differentiation that ensures the prompt is positioned far from others in the embedding space, effectively circumventing the embedding's tendency to group similar content closely. This exercise will enhance our understanding of how embeddings perceive and categorize textual data."
